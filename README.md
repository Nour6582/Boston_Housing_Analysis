# 🏠 Boston Housing Market Analysis

### 📊 Overview
This project analyzes factors that influence housing prices using the **Boston Housing Dataset**.  
It was completed as part of my data analytics journey using **Microsoft Fabric** and **Python**.

### 🎯 Objectives
- Identify key socio-economic and environmental factors affecting housing prices.
- Build and evaluate a Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) model.
- Interpret statistical results and evaluate model performance.

### 🧰 Tools Used
- Microsoft Fabric (Lakehouse & Notebooks)
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Statsmodels)

### 🔍 Key Findings
- Number of rooms (`RM`), student–teacher ratio (`PTRATIO`), and lower-status population (`LSTAT`) significantly influence home prices.
- The model’s Adjusted R² = 0.677, indicating that about 67.7% of price variation is explained by the model.

### 🚀 How to Run
1. Open the notebook file `boston_housing_notebook.ipynb` in Microsoft Fabric or Jupyter.
2. Ensure the dataset (`Boston.csv`) is uploaded to your Lakehouse or local directory.
3. Run all cells sequentially.
